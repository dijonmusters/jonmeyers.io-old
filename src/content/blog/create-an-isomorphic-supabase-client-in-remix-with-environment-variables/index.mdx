description: Environment Variables are a way to make values globally available within the environment our code is running in - either the client's browser or on the web server hosting our app. Environment variables are often used to store secrets - such as an API key. In this article, we look at how to make our secret values available on the server ‚Äî loaders and actions in Remix ‚Äî and how to expose public values ‚Äî such as our Supabase url and anon key ‚Äî to the browser.

## What are Environment Variables?

Environment variables are special values we want to make globally available within whatever environment our code is being executed - either the client's browser or the web server hosting our app. The environment variables on our server are commonly secret values that we don't want to expose to our client's browser, or have embedded in our code and committed to source control - GitHub etc.

> ü§î Environment variables exposed to the client's browser are easily viewable and should only ever be public values that you are happy for anyone to know on the wide wide internet!

Some frameworks ‚Äî such as Next.js ‚Äî include a method for declaring environment variables available to any server-side code, and a naming convention to expose particular values to the browser - prepending with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` in the case of Next.js.

As seen in the [Remix documentation](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/envvars), [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) is supported by default when running locally in development mode. However, these values are only available server-side - loaders and actions etc. If we want to make these values available to our client-side - React components - we will need to do a bit of work. Let's start by creating a new Remix app.

## Creating a Remix app

```bash
npx create-remix@latest
```

This will step through creating our basic Remix project. Feel free to answer the questions however you would like - it shouldn't change anything for this example. I went with the following:

- Just the basics
- Remix App Server
- JavaScript

Now change into the directory and start the Remix development server.

```bash
cd supabase-example
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Let's declare some environment variables!

## Server-side

As mentioned above, environment variables for the server-side are configured out of the box. Simply create a `.env` file and add the values.

```bash
TEST=working
```

> ü§î you will need to restart the dev server anytime a value is added, modified or removed from the .env file.

> üöî the `.env` file is excluded from git commits as Remix automatically adds it to the .gitignore file.

Now if we open up `app/root.jsx` and add the following block, we can see our value printed out in our dev console.

```jsx
export const loader = () => {
  console.log(process.env.TEST);
  return null;
};
```

If we try to move this `console.log(process.env.TEST);` statement to our component we will see the value printed to our dev console - because the first render occurs server-side (SSR) - followed by a big scary Application Error in the browser and a stream of RED in the console!

I guess this means ‚Äúdo not do this in Remix please‚Äù!

Now, to create our Supabase client we need the `url` and `anon key` for our Supabase instance. These are both public values that we don't need to keep secret, provided we have enabled Row Level Security (RLS) for the table - we will cover creating a Supabase instance and enabling RLS later.

> üìπ Checkout [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow_Uzedfohk) to learn more about RLS.

Time to make some environment variables available to the client!

## Client-side

Let's replace the contents of our `.env` file with the following and restart the dev server:

```jsx
SUPABASE_URL = hello - client;
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = also - on - client;
```

> ü§î We will use real values once we have created a Supabase instance.

Again, these values are available in our loader, as it runs on the server. If we want them to be available within our component, we need to pass them from the server to the client ü§ù

Let's modify our loader function in `app/root.jsx` to return these values in an `env` object.

```jsx
export const loader = () => {
  return {
    env: {
      SUPABASE_URL: process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
      SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY,
    },
  };
};
```

Now in our component we can call `useLoaderData` to get the values returned from the `loader` function, and print out the values in the `env` object to the console.

```jsx
import {
  // other imports
  useLoaderData,
} from "remix";

// other exported functions

export default function App() {
  const { env } = useLoaderData();
  console.log({ env });
  // stuff to return
}
```

So now we have the values in our `root.jsx` file, but we want them to be globally accessible within our application. Where can we store them that is available globally in the browser?

The `window`! Welcome back those jQuery vibes! üï∫

Let's add the following `<script>` tag in the `<body>` section of the JSX being returned in `app/root.jsx`.

```jsx
<body>
  <Outlet />
  <script
    dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
      __html: `window.env = ${JSON.stringify(env)}`,
    }}
  />
  // other JSX
</body>
```

After a refresh, we can type `window.env` directly into the browser's console and see our `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

We have successfully piped those environment variables through from `process.env` - available server-side - to our `window` - available on the client! üéâ

Now we just need to wire it up to a Supabase project.

## Creating a Supabase project

> üöÄ Feel free to skip this step if you already have a project up and running!

Head over to [the Supabase website](https://supabase.com/) and click `Start your project`.

> ü§î You will need to authenticate with GitHub if this is your first time.

Once you have reached the Supabase dashboard, click `New project`.

Give it a `Name`, strong `Database Password`, choose a `Region` that is nice and close to you and click `Create new project`.

import newProject from "./new-project.png";

<Image src={newProject} alt="Creating new project in Supabase Dashboard" />

> ‚è≥ It will take a little bit of time to scale up all this infrastructure. Good time for a ‚òïÔ∏è or a üç∫.

Once your project is up and running, we need to create some tables to store our data. We are going to be super creative here and build a blog. Therefore, we need a `posts` table.

This can be done manually through the Table Editor menu, but we are going to head over to the SQL Editor and click `New query`, copy and paste the following and click `RUN`.

```sql
create table posts (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  title text,
  content text
);
```

We should see the text `Success. No rows returned` in the Results section.

We can confirm that this table has been created successfully by heading over to the Table Editor menu and clicking the posts table.

It should look something like this üëá

import newTable from "./new-table.png";

<Image
  src={newTable}
  alt="Supabase Dashboard Table Editor showing new posts table"
/>

Click `Insert row` and add a couple of posts.

import newRows from "./new-rows.png";

<Image
  src={newRows}
  alt="Supabase Dashboard Table Editor showing example posts"
/>

Supabase Dashboard Table Editor showing example posts

Let's create a Supabase client so we can query these posts in our Remix app.

## Supabase client

Head over to [your project's API Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api) and copy the values of your `URL` and `anon` key, and paste them in your `.env` file.

```
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

Now let's install the `@supabase/supabase-js` library to talk to our Supabase instance.

```bash
npm i @supabase/supabase-js
```

Next we want to create a new `utils` folder at `app/utils` and then a new file called `supabase.js` with the following content.

```jsx
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

export default createClient(
  window.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  window.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
);
```

This will create a Supabase client with our environment variables available on the `window`, however, we also want to be able to talk to Supabase from our actions and loaders and on our first SRR render - where there is no `window`.

For this, we need to ask ‚Äúare we currently running in a browser or on the server‚Äù?

```jsx
const isServer = typeof window === "undefined";
```

And then if it is the server, let's use the environment variables from `process.env`, otherwise `window.env`.

```jsx
const supabaseUrl = isServer
  ? process.env.SUPABASE_URL
  : window.env.SUPABASE_URL;

const supabaseAnonKey = isServer
  ? process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  : window.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
```

Now we can update our `createClient` statement to use these variables. The whole file should look something like this.

```jsx
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

const isServer = typeof window === "undefined";

const supabaseUrl = isServer
  ? process.env.SUPABASE_URL
  : window.env.SUPABASE_URL;

const supabaseAnonKey = isServer
  ? process.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  : window.env.SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export default createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey);
```

Now we can instantiate a Supabase client from anywhere in our Remix app.

Let's open up `app/routes/index.jsx` and replace with the following.

```jsx
import supabase from "../utils/supabase";

export default function Index() {
  return <p>Our posts</p>;
}
```

We want to confirm our client-side querying logic is working so let's add a useEffect.

```jsx
import supabase from "../utils/supabase";
import { useEffect } from "react";

export default function Index() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const getPosts = async () => {
      // get posts from Supabase
    };
    getPosts();
  }, []);

  return <p>Our posts</p>;
}
```

Okay, a little bit messy because we need to do some async stuff in `useEffect`, but let's get those posts from Supabase!

```jsx
const { data } = await supabase.from("posts").select("*");
```

Easy! But now we need to store the posts so we can map over them in our component.

A wild `useState` appeared!

```jsx
import supabase from "../utils/supabase";
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";

export default function Index() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const getPosts = async () => {
      const { data } = await supabase.from("posts").select("*");
      setPosts(data);
    };
    getPosts();
  }, []);

  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(posts, null, 2)}</pre>;
}
```

> ü§î `JSON.stringify(posts, null, 2)` is just a way to pretty print a blob of JSON - like this üëá

import posts from "./json-posts.png";

<Image src={posts} alt="Page rendering JSON object of posts" />

Now our posts are displaying correctly in our application, but the code is a bit verbose, and we get that flash of an empty array, while we're waiting for posts to come back from Supabase - hit refresh to see this.

Let's fetch those posts the Remix way!

```jsx
import supabase from "../utils/supabase";
import { useLoaderData } from "@remix-run/react";

export const loader = async () => {
  const { data: posts } = await supabase.from("posts").select("*");
  return { posts };
};

export default function Index() {
  const { posts } = useLoaderData();
  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(posts, null, 2)}</pre>;
}
```

Much cleaner! And no more flash of empty state while we're waiting!

Thanks Remix! üíø

> ü§î You may feel like we wasted a bit of time adding all that client-side stuff to then just request data from Supabase server-side - well spotted! We will be using Supabase client-side for auth and realtime stuff in coming articles.
