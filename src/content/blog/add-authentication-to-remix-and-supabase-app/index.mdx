description: Supabase makes authentication supa simple with the Supabase UI library. In this article, we look at installing this package, wrapping our application in a magic Provider to do the heavy lifting and building a login page — allowing our users to create an account and sign in.

In the [last article](https://jonmeyers.io/blog/create-an-isomorphic-supabase-client-in-remix-with-environment-variables), we looked at creating an isomorphic Supabase client — able to query data on the client and server. Let's add authentication so our users can create accounts and login.

> 🚀 Just want the final version of the code, check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/dijonmusters/remix-supabase-example/tree/main/02-supabase-auth).

## Supabase UI

Supabase make this very easy for us with the `Auth` component from `Supabase UI`. Let's install the package.

```bash
npm i @supabase/ui
```

We can then import the `<Auth>` component in `app/routes/root.jsx`.

```jsx
import { Auth } from "@supabase/ui";
```

We also need our isomorphic Supabase client.

```jsx
import supabase from "./utils/supabase";
```

And now we can wrap our `<Outlet />` component in Supabase's `Provider`.

```jsx
<Auth.UserContextProvider supabaseClient={supabase}>
  <Outlet />
</Auth.UserContextProvider>
```

Now we need a login page so let's create that at `app/routes/login.jsx` and populate with the following.

```jsx
import { Auth } from "@supabase/ui";
import supabase from "../utils/supabase";

export default () => {
  return <Auth supabaseClient={supabase} />;
};
```

And that's it!

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/login, click `Don't have an account? Sign up` and enter an email address and password.

> ❗️ This will need to be a real email address, as it will automatically send an email to verify.

Open up your new email from Supabase and click `Confirm your mail`.

Our user is now authenticated! 🎉 We can confirm this by adding the following to our `app/routes/index.jsx` component.

```jsx
import { Auth } from "@supabase/ui";

// the rest of component declaration
const { session, user } = Auth.useUser();
console.log({ session, user });
```

And we can see the `user` and `session` objects are printed to the browser's console.

```json
{
  "session": null,
  "user": null
}
```

Now this is _technically_ working. We can see the signed in user on the client, but if we were to look on the server — our dev console since the first render uses server-side rendering (SSR) — we would see that both our `user` and `session` are set to `null`.

import userObject from "./user-object.png";

<Image src={userObject} alt="User object" />

What is going on here? 🤔

Supabase Auth takes place client-side and uses `localStorage` to store our user's `accessToken` — automatically forwarded with each client-side query to Supabase. The server does not have access to values in our user's `localStorage`, as this lives in their browser. If we want the server to know who our user is, and forward this information onto our server-side request to Supabase, we need to create a delicious cookie 🍪

And this is exactly what we will tackle in the next article!

Thanks for reading 🙌
