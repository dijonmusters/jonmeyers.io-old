description: Upserting is a convenient way to combine inserting and updating into a single idempotent statement - one that can be run multiple times with the same outcome. PostgreSQL makes this very easy with an insert statement, by using  the on conflict condition.

The `upsert` action is a combination of `insert` and `update`. It allows us to write idempotent statements — can be executed multiple times without breaking everything! — and improve the convenience and resilience of our code.

Thankfully, PostgreSQL makes it super easy to turn any `insert` statement into an `upsert`, using the `on conflict` condition.

Let 's create a new table for users:

```sql
create table if not exists users (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  username text unique,
  email text unique
);
```

One important thing to note here, is that both `username` and `email` are `unique`. Your insert statement needs to include something that is unique, otherwise, Postgres will just keep creating new rows — not idempotent!

So if we try to insert a new user:

```sql
insert into users(username, email)
values('jon', 'jon@supabase.io');
```

No problem!

But try to insert that user again, and we have a BIG problem!

```sql
insert into users(username, email)
values('jon', 'jon@supabase.io');
```

> “Failed to run sql query: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "users_username_key”

Damn!

But, let 's say we wanted our users to be able to update their `email`, but not their `username`. We can tell Postgres “Yo, we got this” by saying if there is a conflict on `username`, just update the `email` field:

```sql
insert into users(username, email)
values('jon', 'jon@supabase.com')
on conflict(username)
do update set email = excluded.email;
```

Now, rather than creating a new record (insert), we have updated the existing one! 🎉

And if we run that same statement with a new `username`, but an `email` that exists we get our error! As expected! 👮‍♀️

```sql
insert into users(username, email)
values('tyler', 'jon@supabase.com')
on conflict(username)
do update set email = excluded.email;
```

However, if we run it with a `username` and `email` that does not yet exist:

```sql
insert into users(username, email)
values('tyler', 'tyler@supabase.com')
on conflict(username)
do update set email = excluded.email;
```

It will just insert a new row, as per usual! 🧠

Additionally, if you 're using [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com), you don 't even need to worry about it! `supabase-js` supports `upsert` statements directly!

```jsx
const { data } = await supabase
  .from("users")
  .upsert(
    { username: "thor", email: "thor@supabase.com" },
    { onConflict: "username" }
  );
```
